## Note about application data source
- I attempted to execute a GET fetch request to the specified data endpoint but received an error stating that no Access-Control-Allow-Origin header was present on the requested resource.
- I decided to create a file within the repository to store the data (STORE.js) in order to continue with the exercise.
